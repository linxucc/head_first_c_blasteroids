/*
 Level, when you clear all the asteroids in this level, you move to next, with more asteroids...
 
 Level controls main gama flow, it contains control information about wether or not to display level number, win, fail, start or not...
 
 For each level, the sequence is:
    Spaceship init, put it in center, new asteroids init
    Display LEVEL X
    Display START
    Fire is open (space bar event ready to response)
    ...Game Play... if Game Over -->> goto Game over state, and never back.
    Display YOU WIN!
    Fire is on hold.
 
 It controls draw what, and wether or not respond to keyboard input. Also when to Put new asteroids and reposition space ship
