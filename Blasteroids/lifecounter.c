 Life Indicator
 
 Important:
    1. To keep it simple, we don't yet free the indicator spaceship's memory after life lost, so potential memory leak could happen.
    2. Life could only be decreased, not they other way around, or there will be segment fault. If there's a way that could get back life, the total count of spaceship may exceed the initial one, the array access will fail, which should cause a segment fault.
 */

 Init a empty life counter to initial values, with configurable options.

 draw_begin_x, draw_begin_y: where to draw the first indicator (assume from left to right), the x,y of first one
